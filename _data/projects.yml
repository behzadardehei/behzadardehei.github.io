    Starcade is an addictive online arcade. Itâ€™s survival of the fittest. Gaining points upgrades your armour, weaponry and thruster systems. Beware though, the stronger you get, the bigger target you become with more points awarded for destroying higher class ships. Choose specific level up options when you get stronger.
